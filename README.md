First](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-physchem-071119-040123) 

Review article about modern computational chemistry methods to explore the chemical reactions. It adopts a meta-conceptual perspective aimed at the definition of common general concepts and requirements, such as categorizing mechanistic strategies, and identification of elementary reaction steps and hardly touch upon the natural extension and combination with subsequent kinetic modeling.

### potentials
 [Smith, Lubbers, et. al, Less is more: Sampling chemical space with active learning,J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241733 (2018)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5023802)
 
 Paper presents an automated approach for the generation of the data set with the target to train a machine learning potentials. The algorithm begins with the reduction of an existing dataset to remove redundant data without loss of accuracy. Then uses the active learning algorithm based on Query by Committee (QBC). 
 
 

### ab initio nanoreactors
[Martínez et al., Discovering chemistry with an ab initio nanoreactor, Nature Chemistry 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2099)

Nanoreactors use ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) exploring reaction pathways by taking an intermediate stance between physically realistic simulation and rule-based enumeration approaches. <bn>
The pathways that result from energy refinement are applicable to any thermodynamic setting by providing reaction parameters (for example, concentration, temperature) as input variables to a kinetic model. The article demonstrates two ab initio nanoreactor simulations. The acetylene nanoreactor simulation undergoes the polymerization, while the Urey-Miller simulation generates a complex network of reactions. This presents a nanoreactor as a purely discovery-based method to generate new chemical insight into the reactions

### transition metals

[Kulik et al. Accurate Multiobjective Design in a Space of Millions of Transition Metal Complexes with Neural-Network-Driven Efficient Global Optimization, ACS Cent. Sci. 2020, 6, 513−524](https://pubs.acs.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1021/acscentsci.0c00026&ref=pdf) 

This work present ML- and DFT-driven multiobjective transition metal complex design workflow and apply it to redox flow battery (RFB) redox couple discovery. They constructed a 2.8 M compound space of 700k candidate bulky ligands that are expected to form stable complexes with four open-shell transition metal ions; implemented efficient global optimization (EGO) with a two-dimensional expected improvement (EI) criterion to balance exploration and exploitation at the Pareto front. A multitask ANN with latent-distance-based uncertainty quantification (UQ) metrics generalizes better than a Gaussian process. 

### materials

[Xie and Grosmann, Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for an Accurate and Interpretable Prediction of Material Properties,PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 120, 145301 (2018) Crystal](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.145301)

The article presents a generalized crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN) framework for representing periodic crystal systems that provide both material property prediction with density functional theory (DFT) accuracy and atomic level chemical insights.
